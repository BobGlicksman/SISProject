# SISOverview.

This repository contains overview documents that describe the SIS project.  SIS stands for "Standalone Intelligent Sensor" system. The documents in this repository explain the SIS concept and provide functional specifications for SIS.

We are looking for people who are interested in collaborating on this project. We are two hobbyists who work on the SIS in our spare time. You don't have to be a hardcore, gung-ho, work on it until you drop, kind of person; we certainly aren't. Collaboration could just mean that you'd like to have one of these to install somewhere. We are willing to make changes to the code to fit your need, as long as you provide us feedback on how it works and ideas on how to improve it.

Of course collaboration could also mean that you want to add functions to the core firmware or javascript web site. That would be cool too.

Send us a message to join in the fun.
